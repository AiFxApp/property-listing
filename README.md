## About 1st Task
    - First task was to complete the search query from home page.

## What I have done
    - Completed property search by Rent/Sale, Type, Bedrooms, Price range.
    - Use form as Component
    - Use property item as Component
    - Display search result in the property page with query message under the title
    - Display the count of the total search property
    - Use TailWind grid box to design the "property card" (each item height is equal)
    - Use Tailwind @apply css to style the search form
